<h1>Visa Checkout Terms of Service</h1>
<p>IMPORTANT: PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING VISA CHECKOUT TERMS OF SERVICE ("TERMS"). VISA CHECKOUT IS THE NEW NAME FOR THE SERVICE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS V.ME BY VISA AND YOU MAY CONTINUE TO SEE BOTH NAMES USED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. YOU HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS IF YOU HAVE CREATED A VISA CHECKOUT ACCOUNT OR USED VISA CHECKOUT OR HAVE CLICKED AN "I ACCEPT" BUTTON OR AN EQUIVALENT INDICATOR WITH REGARDS TO THE USE OF VISA CHECKOUT, THESE TERMS REPLACE ALL PRIOR TERMS IN RESPECT TO V.ME BY VISA AND VISA CHECKOUT.</p>
<ol><li><h2>Visa Checkout and the Visa Checkout Account Service</h2><p>Visa Checkout is operated by Visa U.S.A. Inc. and its affiliates. As used in these terms, "Visa", "us", "we" or similar pronoun refers to the Visa entity that provides Visa Checkout to you, which depends on where you reside, as set out in Section 19.h below.</p><p>As used in these Terms, the term "Visa Checkout" shall mean all of the following: all Visa Checkout features, functionality and services, now available or added in the future, whether available through the Visa Checkout website or mobile site as operated as a domain or subdomain ("Website") or through an application or functionality offered by an issuing bank or payment institution, merchant, or other third party (collectively, "Services"); the logos, designs, text, images, videos, graphics, software and other content and materials of Visa or its licensors available through Visa Checkout, and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, "Content"); and Visa's hardware, software and networks associated with making Visa Checkout available to you (collectively, the "Visa Checkout System").</p><p>Visa Checkout offers you (i) the ability to store account and other related information such as billing and shipping addresses ("Card Details") for your Visa credit, debit and prepaid cards and other cards or payment methods that Visa has decided are eligible to be used with the Visa Checkout Services ("Eligible Cards") to create a Visa Checkout account ("Account"); and (ii) the ability to use the Visa Checkout Service as a method of checkout at merchants that display the Visa Checkout mark.</p><p>When you use the Visa Checkout Services as a checkout method, we will transmit certain information to the merchant in order to authenticate you and the Eligible Card for the transaction and allow the merchant to process the transaction. You agree that the merchant can transmit information about the transaction to the applicable network for your Eligible Card and that your transaction will be paid for using the Eligible Card you have selected. <u>While Visa Checkout helps facilitate the transaction, Visa is not a party to the transaction and the purchase or return of goods or services from a merchant in connection with your use of the Services is solely between you and the merchant.</u></p><p><u>If you require a refund or reversal of any transaction completed using the Services, you must contact the applicable merchant and/or the financial institution or other entity which issued the Eligible Card (each, an "Issuer") you used for the transaction. Please remember that Visa is not a party to the transaction, and thus Visa is not able to resolve any such issues that you may have with the transaction.</u></p><p>You acknowledge that the Card Details stored in your Account or provided through use of the Services are provided by you and contain personal financial information. You may only use Cards in connection with Services if your Issuer regards you as the primary or supplementary cardholder and your name is embossed on the Card. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the Card Details and other information you store in your Account or provide through use of the Services. Although Visa may perform certain validation checks for Card Details for Visa cards, Visa is not responsible for the accuracy of Card Details or the other information you provide, including whether Card Details are current and up-to-date. However, you agree that if your Issuer is entitled to provide updated information about your Eligible Cards (such as a new card number or expiry date) to third parties, your Issuer may also provide that information to us. From time to time we may ask you for additional information which you must provide in order to continue to use one or more of the Services.</p><p>Visa Checkout is not a bank or payment account and does not offer any credit to you or a merchant. Any transaction that you effect using the Services will be reflected in the account which relates to the Eligible Card you employ for the transaction. Payment of that account is solely a matter between you and the Issuer of the Eligible Card.</p></li><li><h2>Changes to Visa Checkout</h2><p>Visa may, in its sole discretion, terminate, change, modify, suspend, make improvements to or discontinue any or all aspects of Visa Checkout, temporarily or permanently, including the availability of any Service, at any time with or without notice to you and you agree that Visa shall not be liable to you or to any third party as a result of taking any of these actions.</p></li><li><h2>Service Terms</h2><p>Certain Services may be subject to additional terms, conditions or policies specific to the Service ("Service Terms"). Applicable Service Terms will be provided to you prior to your use of the Service that requires such additional terms. Unless otherwise expressly noted, all Service Terms are incorporated by reference into these Terms and form part of these Terms. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any Service Terms, the Service Terms will control solely with respect to that Service.</p><p>Not all Services may be available to all Accounts or Eligible Cards. Furthermore, Visa may, in its sole discretion, remove Eligible Cards from Accounts or prevent Eligible Cards from being enrolled in an Account, and Visa may also revise at any time the eligibility of specific or general debit and prepaid cards and other cards or payment methods that constitute Eligible Cards.</p></li><li><h2>Eligibility</h2><p>The Visa Checkout Service is only available to individuals who are:</p><p>(i) residents of one of the following jurisdictions: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, the United States (including Puerto Rico), or the United Arab Emirates, as each country is made available;</p><p>(ii) of the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction, province or territory of residence; and</p><p>(iii) the primary cardholder or authorized user of one or more Eligible Cards, and in good standing with respect to their Eligible Card accounts.</p></li><li><h2>Registration and Account Security</h2><p>If you choose to register for an Account, you agree to provide us with true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and update us if there are changes to the information. You acknowledge and agree that Visa will have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to maintain accurate registration information, including your failure to receive important information and updates about the Services. If Visa has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provided to us is untrue, inaccurate or incomplete, Visa may suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) by you.</p><p>As a part of your Account registration, you are required to establish a username and password. These pieces of data are used to authenticate you when you use the Services. They act as your signature. For your protection, you should memorize your username, password and responses to your security questions, if any, and not keep notation of them on or with your personal computer, tablet, mobile device or other device used to access the Services. You are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your username and password. It is important that you do so since we are not responsible for any losses you incur as a result of unauthorized use of your Account and, depending on the circumstances, your Issuer may hold you responsible for unauthorized use of your Eligible Card account. You agree to notify Visa immediately of any unauthorized use of your user name or password, or any other actual or potential security breach relating to your Account.</p><p>You are responsible for all use of your Account and for ensuring that use of or access to your Account and use of the Services complies fully with these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that any use of the Services occurring through your username and password shall be deemed to be your actions and that Visa may rely upon such actions.</p><p>We regularly review the security measures for the Services. However, we cannot guarantee that information you transmit via the Internet is entirely secure. When you submit information using the Services, you accept that you do so at your own risk.</p><p>We do not guarantee that the Services are virus-free or that access to it will be free from interruptions.</p></li><li><h2>Cardholder Agreements</h2><p>These Terms do not amend or otherwise modify any agreement with your Issuer in respect of an Eligible Card ("Cardholder Agreement"). In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and your Cardholder Agreement with your Issuer, these Terms govern as to the relationship between you and Visa solely with respect to Visa Checkout and your Cardholder Agreement with your Issuer governs as to the relationship between you and your Issuer. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services complies with any Cardholder Agreement with your Issuer.</p></li><li><h2>Charges, Fees and Taxes</h2><p>You are solely responsible for acquiring any hardware, devices, software, wireless and Internet access, other items required for you to use or access Visa Checkout, and any associated fees, expenses or other charges. You are also solely responsible for any interest, fees, charges or expenses of the Issuer of any Eligible Cards you are using in connection with the Services and for any taxes or tax reporting obligations in connection with your use of the Services.</p></li><li><h2>Social Media and Email</h2><p>The Visa Checkout Website may include links to popular social media sites that allow you, for example, to "like" Visa Checkout or to post or send messages about your experiences with Visa Checkout. If you choose to use these social media platforms, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, these Terms, and any terms, conditions and restrictions of the particular social media platform.</p><p>The Visa Checkout website or mobile site may also provide an option for you to send another person an email about Visa Checkout. If you provide another person’s email address to us, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to do so and you expressly authorize us to send the email on your behalf.

PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY.  IT PROVIDES THAT ANY CLAIM RELATING TO VISA CHECKOUT OR THESE TERMS SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION.   IN ARBITRATION NEITHER YOU NOR VISA WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT, OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THE CLAIMS.  CLAIMS MAY BE ARBITRATED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  PRE-HEARING DISCOVERY RIGHTS AND POST-HEARING APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED, BUT THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS PERMITTED UNDER THESE TERMS.</b></p><p>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to Visa Checkout or these Terms, including the formation, interpretation, breach, performance, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms, the validity and enforcement of this provision, and the determination of the scope or applicability of the agreement to arbitrate (a “Dispute”) that can be subject to arbitration, shall be resolved exclusively pursuant to the process and arbitration clause set out in this section.  Any Disputes between you and Visa shall be resolved through binding arbitration; except that, if you are a US resident, you may assert claims in small claims court (if your claims qualify).  This arbitration clause only applies to Disputes with Visa regarding Visa Checkout, if you have a dispute with your payment card issuer you must resolve that dispute with your issuer.</p><p>The rules governing any arbitration between you and Visa are as follows:  The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if you reside in the United States and JAMS’ International Arbitration Rules if you reside outside the United States within the countries listed in this Section (1.), to the extent that those rules do not conflict with this provision.  You may obtain a copy of these rules by contacting JAMS at 1-800-352-5267, by writing to JAMS at 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018 or online at www.jamsadr.com or www.jamsinternational.com/.</p><p><b>ANY CLAIM SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  THIS MEANS THAT BOTH YOU AND VISA ARE PROHIBITED FROM JOINING OR CONSOLIDATING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHERS, AND ARE PROHIBITED FROM ARBITRATING ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS.</b> The arbitration will take place before one arbitrator.  The arbitration shall (i) be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; and (ii) not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.  Residents of the United Arab Emirates shall arbitrate in Dubai unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.  The arbitrator will be mutually agreed upon by you and Visa.  If you and Visa cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be appointed according to JAMS procedures.  . If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we both waive any right to a jury trial.</p><p>You may elect to hire an attorney, but are not required to do so.  Each party will be responsible for its own attorney fees and costs, unless awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law.  The party that initiates the arbitration will pay the filing fee (unless otherwise dictated by JAMS due to a finding of hardship).  Visa will advance all other administration, case management and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, through payment directly to JAMS.  At the end of the arbitration, the fees paid by Visa may be allocated between you and Visa at the direction of the arbitrator in compliance with JAMS procedures.</p><p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.  Any decision of the arbitrator shall be final.  Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  Visa’s liability is limited as described in Section 14 above, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p><p>This section and arbitration provision shall survive the termination of your Visa Checkout account.  If any part of this section, other than waivers of class action rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall remain enforceable.  If a waiver of class actions rights is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made, the remainder of this section shall be unenforceable.</p><p>These Terms and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.</p><p>The remainder of this Section (1.) applies to US residents: <br>The arbitrator cannot award punitive or exemplary damages, except as may be required by statute, or any pre-award interest; nor may the arbitrator award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits or harm suffered by third parties.  The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce.  Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the Terms and this section shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).</p><p>If you established your Visa Checkout Account prior to the update of these terms on January 27, 2014, you may opt-out of this arbitration clause by submitting written notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) to Visa postmarked by March 31, 2015.
